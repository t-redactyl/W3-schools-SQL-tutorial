# W3-schools-SQL-tutorial

This repo contains a collection of exercises I have used to learn SQL. 
* **SQL tutorial.sql** contains a script with notes and exercises from the [W3 Schools SQL tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/)
* **ComputerStore1.sql** to **ComputerStore20**, **ex01_creation.sql**, and **ex01.db** are the querying exercises from [Wikibooks "The Computer Store"](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SQL_Exercises/The_computer_store). These were completed in SQLite3.
