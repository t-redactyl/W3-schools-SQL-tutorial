# Constraints
# Used to specify rules for the data in a table. In SQL, we have the 
# following constraints:

# NOT NULL - Indicates that a column cannot store NULL value
# UNIQUE - Ensures that each row for a column must have a unique value
# PRIMARY KEY - A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE. 
# Ensures that a column (or combination of two or more columns) have a 
# unique identity which helps to find a particular record in a table 
# more easily and quickly
# FOREIGN KEY - Ensure the referential integrity of the data in 
# one table to match values in another table
# CHECK - Ensures that the value in a column meets a specific condition
# DEFAULT - Specifies a default value for a column
